## Feature Request
### Describe the Feature
Describe why the feature when the feature would be used.
*I'm making a solar system information table! It would be convenient if you stored planetary constants!*

### Write an Example
Give an example of the function or variable with defined parameters. Include the expected output in comment marks after it.
```js
orbConstant.earth.diamter; // 7,917.5
orbConstant.jupiter.mass; // 1.898E27
orbConstant.mercury.orbitalPeriod; // 88
```

### Sell us on It
Why is this feature useful for a light-weight astronomy repository?
*It's difficult to find certain information like eccentricity of planets! You are already needing to store some constants for calculations!*

### Additional Comments (Optional)
Is there anything else you would like to input on your feature request?
*It might be easier for me to use functions that retrieves the constants!*
```js
functionName("Earth", "diameter"); // 7,917.5
functionName("Jupiter", "mass"); // 1.898E27
functionName("Mercury", "orbital period"); // 88
```
