## Bug Reports
### Describe the bug
A clear and concise description of what the bug is.

### To Reproduce
Write the function name and all inputs used. Variables instead of inputs aren't allowed unless defined earlier.
```js
const input1 = "Hello World!";
const input2 = 42;
console.log(functionName(input1, input2, false));
```

### Expected Output
Describe exactly what the output should be, use http://cosinekitty.com/solar_system.html. Exclude any numerical errors caused from inputting dates beyond 1900 and 2100.

### Actual Output
What was the output? Give exactly the output received when calling the function using console.log(). If a function isn't entirely writen out (like it returns an [object Object]) search up a string conversion with that data type or submit it regardless.
